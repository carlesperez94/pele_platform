Prepare your own PPI-PELE simulation
######################################

PPI-package aims to find PPI inhibitors and allosteric modulators to disrupt protein protein contacts. 
This module takes half a day to run. 
It will retrieve the most putative binding modes of your ligand all around the surface of your target.

To start with the simulation follow the instructions below:

1. Complex Preparation
======================
   
Prepare the system with maestro (Protein Preparation Wizard, hydrogen optimization and posterior minimization)
and output a complex.pdb. The complex.pdb must contain the protein-ligand in any configuration as later PPIPELE
will place the ligand all over the protein.

Make sure the ligand has:

 - Unique chain
 - No atomnames with spaces or single letter
 - Any residuename except UNK

2. Input Preparation
=====================
 
Prepare the input file ``input.yml``:

To run different modes prepare different control files.
For more explanation on the modes please refer to `here <../documentation/index.html>`__


PPI input
----------------

..  code-block:: yaml

   system: 'docking2grid6n4b_thc.pdb'
   chain: 'L'
   resname: 'THC'
   seed: 12345
   atom_dist:
   - 4059
   - 4556
   ppi: true


3. Run simulation
====================


To run the system launch the simulation with the next command:

``python -m pele_platform.main input.yml``
