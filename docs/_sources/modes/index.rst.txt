Platform Modes
######################################

Here you have a general description of all possible modes and a specific description of
each of them.


The platform is divided in two big packages called:

- PELE: Design to explore the protein-ligand conformational space in matter of hours. You can perform:

  - Pose Prediction

  - Docking Refinment

  - Pocket Exploration with pose prediction

  - Receptor sampling via PCA

  - Pose minimization

  - Binding and unbinding path

  |

- FragPELE

  - HT-fragment screening

  - peptide growing (Into development)
